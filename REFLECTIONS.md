## Project Reflections

## What went well

One thing that went well in this project was breaking the application into separate modules. Separating the menu logic, quiz logic, and data handling helped keep the code organized and made it easier to debug. I was able to consistently test my code, which helped me quickly identify what was working and where errors were occurring. I also improved my understanding of prompt-sync, functions, loops, and conditionals while building the quiz flow.

## Challenges I faced

A major challenge was managing data between different files, especially transferring scores and percentages from a quiz round to the leaderboard. I also struggled with debugging errors related to function imports and exports. Through this process, I learned more about how prompt-sync works and why certain logic should only be called once in the appropriate file.

## How I overcame those challenges

I overcame these challenges by staying organized, using console.log statements to trace values, carefully reviewing error messages, and refactoring my code to ensure each function had a single responsibility. Asking questions and testing small pieces of functionality at a time helped me make steady progress.

## What I learned

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Structure a Node.js project
- Use prompt-sync for user input
- Pass data between modules
- Debug common JavaScript errors
- Think through user experience in a CLI application
- What I would do differently next time

Next time, I would plan the data flow more thoroughly before writing code. I would also create pseudocode and diagrams earlier in the process to reduce the need for refactoring later.

## Reflection on AI Usage

During this project, I used AI as a learning assistant to help me better understand certain JavaScript concepts, think through logic problems, and organize my files and code more effectively. AI suggestions were used as guidance, but I made sure to understand and implement all solutions myself. This process helped strengthen my problem-solving skills and confidence in building a CLI application.

## Final Thoughts

This project helped reinforce core JavaScript concepts and allowed me to see those concepts come to life in a complete application. It also gave me more confidence in building a full project from scratch. Something I would have liked to add to my project was the ability to clear the scoreboard if the user wanted to.
