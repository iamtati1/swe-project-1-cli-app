# Project Reflections

## What went well
One thing that went well in this project was breaking the application into separate modules. Separating the menu logic, quiz logic, and data handling helped keep the code organized and easier to debug.

I also improved my understanding of functions, loops, and conditionals while building the quiz flow.

---

## Challenges I faced
A major challenge was managing data between different files, especially transferring scores and percentages from a quiz round to the leaderboard. I also struggled with debugging errors related to function imports and exports.

---

## How I overcame those challenges
I overcame these challenges by using console.log to trace values, carefully reviewing error messages, and refactoring my code to ensure each function had a single responsibility. Asking questions and testing small pieces of functionality helped a lot.

---

## What I Learned
Through this project, I learned how to:
- Structure a Node.js project
- Use prompt-sync for user input
- Pass data between modules
- Debug common JavaScript errors
- Think through user experience in a CLI application

---

## What I would do differently next time
Next time, I would plan the data flow more thoroughly before coding. I would also write pseudocode and diagrams earlier to avoid refactoring later.

---

## Final Thoughts
This project helped reinforce core JavaScript concepts and gave me confidence building a complete application from scratch.
