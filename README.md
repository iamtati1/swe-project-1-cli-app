# 🧠 CLI Quiz Game

## Description
This is a command-line quiz game built with Node.js.  
Players can choose different quiz categories (Math, Science, Reading, Language) and difficulties (easy, medium, hard), answer questions, and earn scores based on their performance. Scores are tracked and displayed on a leaderboard.

This project was created as part of a software engineering program to practice JavaScript fundamentals, modular code, and user interaction in the terminal. I was able to create a uniform project with toptier organization by using prompt, ui and more.
